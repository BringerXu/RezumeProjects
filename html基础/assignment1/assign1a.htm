Hi, my name is Zhengyi Xu and my major is computer science. I have no working experience yet. I have learned python and c++, but I have never tried html. 
This is the first online computer class for me. I am so exciting that I can study html in OCC because when I tried to use python scrapy some website I really want to become a pro in website design.
